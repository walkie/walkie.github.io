<h1 id="software-projects">Software Projects</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm primarily a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> hacker, though I enjoy
learning new languages and so tend to dabble in lots of them. This page
provides links and brief descriptions of a few projects I‚Äôve worked on that are
freely available.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/walkie">My GitHub profile</a></strong> contains a motley collection of other small
demos, experiments, and prototypes developed over the years.</p>
<h2 id="frame-homepageframehome-githubframegit">Frame (<a href="http://frame-lang.org/">Homepage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/frame-lang/frame_transpiler">GitHub</a>)</h2>
<p>Frame is an open-source DSL, implemented in Rust, used to model a software
system‚Äôs behavior using state diagrams in a style similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram#Harel_statechart">Harel‚Äôs
statecharts</a>. Frame specifications can be compiled into code and
documentation in a variety of languages.</p>
<p>I am not the creator of Frame, but I have been a major contributor. Aside from
bugfixes, improvements, and general maintenance, I led some larger efforts in
the early development of Frame, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Designed and implemented a runtime system for Frame‚Äôs Rust backend that
provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A callback interface to be notified of all Frame-level events.</li>
<li>A reflection interface for querying all aspects of running Frame models.</li>
<li>Dynamic visualizations of running Frame models.</li>
<li>Configurable event and transition history tracking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Added a crate with supporting documentation for integrating Frame models into
larger Rust projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a hierarchical configuration system for customizing the behavior of
Frame using a combination of configuration files, properties defined within a
Frame model, and/or command-line options passed to the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed a set of example Frame models exercising Frame‚Äôs features and their
interactions, along with a corresponding integration test suite for the Rust
backend.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hagl-haskell-game-language-homepagehaglhome-githubhaglgit">Hagl: Haskell Game Language (<a href="./projects/hagl.html">Homepage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/walkie/Hagl/">GitHub</a>)</h2>
<p><p>A DSL embedded in Haskell for <em>experimental/evolutionary game theory</em>. Hagl
supports defining a wide variety of games and strategies, then executing them
repeatedly in order to collect and observe the results.</p>
<p>Hagl provides built-in support for standard game representations, such as
normal and extensive form, and constructs for defining games in terms of the
manipulation of a shared state (as in tic-tac-toe). More exotic game
representations can be added by instantiating a type class.</p>
<p>A monadic sub-DSL supports concise and vaguely English-like definitions of
strategies for playing these games, usually iteratively.</p>
<p>While Hagl provides some basic game analyses, its primary focus is on
simulation and experimentation. Games can be executed and strategies can be
pitted against each other for repeated play and in various tournament formats.</p></p>
<h2 id="resource-dsl-githubresourcedsl">Resource DSL (<a href="https://github.com/walkie/Resource-DSL">GitHub</a>)</h2>
<p>A DSL implemented in Haskell for modeling the resource constraints in highly
configurable systems. This DSL, which rather embarrassingly never got a proper
name, was the main deliverable for a 4.5-year contract as part of the <a href="https://github.com/darpa-brass/brass">DARPA
BRASS</a> program.</p>
<p>The language enables modeling a software system, the environment it is expected
to run in, and the capabilities it is expected to perform, as components that
require and provide ‚Äúresources‚Äù. Resources may correspond to concrete external
entities or quantities, such as required sensors, amount of network bandwidth,
or a set of installed libraries, or may be a more abstract capability, such as
<em>wayfinding</em>, that is provided by a component in the system.</p>
<p>Additionally, the system‚Äôs components, their connections, the environment, and
the system‚Äôs expectations are all <em>configurable</em>. This reflects actual software
variation in the system, along with the range of possible environments and
needs that the system might be expected to perform. The state space of models
defined in this way grows exponentially as new components and configuration
options are added.</p>
<p>The DSL‚Äôs interpreter applies <a href="./projects/variational-programming.html">variational programming</a> techniques to
support efficient analyses of the huge state spaces generated by these models.
In particular, it supports efficient exhaustive searches for configurations
that satisfy requirement-provision interfaces among components and for the
system as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="hakyll-academic-webpage-githubwebpagegit">Hakyll Academic Webpage (<a href="https://github.com/walkie/academic-webpage">GitHub</a>)</h2>
<p>This is the code used to statically generate my old academic web page, made
available as an example application of the <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> static site
generator library in Haskell.</p>
<p>I know it‚Äôs being used by a handful of folks around the world, thanks to folks
emailing me‚Ä¶ and because some haven‚Äôt changed the Google Analytics key! üò¨</p>
<p>The most unique feature is its support for publications. I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/walkie/academic-webpage/blob/main/haskell/WebPage/Pubs/Paper.hs">tiny
DSL</a> for representing publication entries, which are then loaded into
Hakyll‚Äôs context. Publications can then be enumerated in various ways, or
individually cited from within Markdown or HTML pages.</p>
<p>The code that generates the web page you‚Äôre reading right now is an evolution
of the code linked above. However, I‚Äôve not (yet!) released the code for this
one since I want to separate a reusable template from the content this time
around, for a variety of obvious reasons.</p>
<h2 id="modular-pcf-githubmodpcf">Modular PCF (<a href="https://github.com/walkie/modular-pcf/">GitHub</a>)</h2>
<p>A Haskell implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus">simply typed</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_Computable_Functions">PCF</a> extended by a
simple <a href="https://jozefg.bitbucket.io/posts/2015-01-08-modules.html">ML-style module system</a>. Developed to support a course that I
taught on modularity at Oregon State University.</p>
<p>The code is written in a simple style (e.g.¬†it uses pattern matching and
recursive functions in many places where a more idiomatic Haskell program would
use monads and higher-order functions) with lots of documentation, in an
attempt to be useful for pedagogical purposes.</p>
